Description: PlantCare.R is a Shiny app that givs advice on how to care for common houseplants. This includes advice on whether to water your plant, use fertilizer, or change the lightining conditions for the plant. The advice is based on the type of plant and current characteristics (i.e., whether the soild feels dry, whether the leaves are droopy). We assume you are close to your plant while using the app.
